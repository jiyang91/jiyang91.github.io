  I am Jiyang Lee from South Korea. I am a Research Engineer in LG Display, Vision Inspection Team, doing research on detection algorithms(Rule-based, MLDL) in display manufacturing fields.

  I worked at KIST(Korea Institute of Science and Technology), developing a skewed-legged quadruped robot, and CSCAM, designing semiconductor machienes and anomaly detection program for Cell-Phone Frame.

  Previously, I completed my master work on Developing Computer vision based path planning robotic system, CAD/CAM lab in Sogang University, Seoul, working in the group headed by Cheol-Soo Lee. I published <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0951192X.2018.1429669">Path planning for SCARA robot based on marker detection using feature extraction and, labelling.</a>

          - What I contributed

              My project in master course was Developing Automated PET Dispenser. 

              The main objective of this work is developing the production system for radioactive products using the SCARA robot. 

              It help protecting workers from exposing to radioactive.

              This project taught me a lot. C++ MFC was the language all I could use, and I should control and communicate with robots and

          - What I contributed

              I tried to build classification model for Fine Metal Mask(FMM). Dataset(6-classes) has some issues: Human-error, imbalanced dataset. Initially, I tried to use Resnet with Mixup augmentation. The result was 40% Accuracy. To improve the accuracy, I removed meaningless classes and tried to use Few-shot learning(MAML, ProtoNet, ProtoMAML). The result improved to about 80% accuracy with 4 classes.

          - What I contributed

              I developed quadruped robot with smart motor. During designing, I was focused on compatibility between modules. In final model, most of parts are compatible except main plates. I completly assembled quadruped robot and experimented simple angular motions in static state. In addition, installing camera module on robot and experimented it's status.

          - Review

              I did a mistake during designing this robot: wrongly using Smart motor. I tried my motor ratio for extending velocity range. However, this decision made system and design weaker. Complex design had a negative influence on not only weigth but also mechanism. It must be better to use motor as it is.
