  I am Jiyang Lee from South Korea. I am a Data scientist in LG Display, Vision Inspection Team, doing research on detection algorithms(Rule-based, MLDL) in display manufacturing fields.

  I worked at KIST(Korea Institute of Science and Technology), developing a skewed-legged quadruped robot, and CSCAM, designing semiconductor machienes and anomaly detection program for Cell-Phone Frame.

  Previously, I completed my master work on Developing Computer vision based path planning robotic system, CAD/CAM lab in Sogang University, Seoul, working in the group headed by Cheol-Soo Lee. I published <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0951192X.2018.1429669">Path planning for SCARA robot based on marker detection using feature extraction and, labelling.</a>
